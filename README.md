The development of the music player begins by setting up the structure, which includes essential elements like audio playback, control buttons (play, pause, next, previous), and a section to display the current song title. This layout forms the foundation for user interaction.

Next, styling is applied to enhance the visual appearance, ensuring the player is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The buttons are designed to be responsive and visually distinct, and the layout is centered to create a clean, user-friendly interface.

The core functionality is added through JavaScript, which enables users to control the music, such as playing, pausing, and skipping songs. JavaScript manages the song list, updates the display, and handles button clicks. With well-organized file structure and dynamic interaction, the result is a fully functional and attractive music player that works seamlessly in a browser.
